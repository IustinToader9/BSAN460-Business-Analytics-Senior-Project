Final project for BSAN460 â€“ Business Analytics Senior Project.
Our group attempted to forecast the flow rate of two Italian water springs, Madonna di Canneto and Lupa.
The datasets were provided by the Acea Group, one of the leading Italian multi-utility operators. 
For this project, our group implemented the following models for prediction: Univariate ARIMA, Multivariate Arima, and LSTM Neural Networks.
Furthermore, we explored our analysis across 3 levels of data aggregation: daily, weekly, and monthly. 
Our results, as well as a more in-depth overview of the methodology used can be found in the accompanying Final Report and Final Presentation.
